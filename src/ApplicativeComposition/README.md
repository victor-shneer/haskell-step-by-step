# Applicative composition. Validation example

Content for this module was inspired and dictated by this article:
[Applicative validation by Mark Seemann] https://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/11/05/applicative-validation/  

Similar concept in DAML [To the code] https://github.com/victor-shneer/daml-studies/blob/main/daml/ApplicativeValidation/DataValidation.daml

# TODOs
- [x] put a link here to DAML DA.Validation module when it ready
- [] test each validation function
- [] instanciate Eq for Reseravtion and rewrite test to compare Validation outcome with data value not String
